The user should use this app to play a card game. The premise of the game is you get delt 13 cards evenly between 4 people then players take turns chosing a player to have to play that card. It is a fun drinking game as well if you are into that. As of right now it is only a one player game and player 1 win almost every hand. This will be fixed with websockets and the ability for each player to choose a card from their hand. Right now only Player 1 chooses.

As long as the game is played linear you can play all the way through. Each set ends when 4 cards are player or all 4 player have played any avaliable cards.
