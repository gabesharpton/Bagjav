     {/* <p>The game is Bagjav, Created by Blanca Cisneros, Alex Hackney, Gabe Sharpton, Joseph Torres, Allee Jackson, and Vance Hackney. The rules are every card in the deck is dealt out to players evenly. If there are more than 4 players in a game 2 decks are delt. The mission is to have the least amount of points at the end of the round. The round ends when one player plays their last card in their hand. Then everyone adds up how many cards you have and the values are what the face of that card is. Jack, Queen and King are all worth 10 points, but the Ace is worth 30! You dont want to keep an Ace. The way you play the Ace is if it is your turn and you dont have that suit then you can play the Ace. The Ace automatically ends that set. You cannot play the Ace if you were initially attacked. To start the game the player left of the dealer starts by chosing a card from their hand and 'attacks' another player. The attacked player now has to play as many cards of that value they have in their hand. If there is less than 4 cards of that value (or an Ace has not been played) Then the next person has a chance to play that value. If they dont have that value but have an Ace then they can play the Ace then and end that set. After a set is over the next person chooses a person to attack. play until every player has delt, then add up all the scores. The player with the lowest score wins!</p> */}
