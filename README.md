This is a card game I created with my friends!
---
## This app will use:
1) HTML
2) CSS
3) React

## MVP
It should be a card game that a single player can play all the way through. I am excited to learn the how I can make this game into a multiplayer game and potentially add some CSS animations in it. 

## Things I would like extra
1) Back-end to keep track of all the games
2) Websockets to allow real player to join and play together
3) Some cool animations
4) TDD
5)
